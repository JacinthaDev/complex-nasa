# About this project
This project uses an API to find all the NASA locations in the US and return the current temperature at that location.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time using two APIs in the same project and having them communicate with each other. It was a learning process. I had to assure that I was storing information from one API in a way that the other could understand and return additional information.
